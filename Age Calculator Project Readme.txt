Age Calculator Project  

About The Project

Objective: The objective of creating an Age Calculator website using React is to build a simple, interactive web application
	   that allows users to calculate their age based on their birthdate. This project aims to provide a hands-on learning 	  	   experience for React developers while accomplishing the following key goals:

1. Age Calculation Functionality:
	•The primary objective is to implement the logic to calculate a person's age in years based on their inputted birthdate 	 and the current date.
	•This involves handling date differences and possibly accounting for leap years.

2. Interactive User Interface:
	•Use React components to create a user-friendly interface where users can select their birthdate using a date picker or 	 manually enter it.
	•Display the calculated age dynamically as soon as the user inputs their birthdate.

3. Form Handling and Validation:
	•Validate the user input to ensure that a valid birthdate is entered (e.g., prevent users from entering a future date or 	 invalid date formats).
	•Provide meaningful error messages for invalid input and guide the user to correct it.

4. Use of React State and Event Handling:
	•Use React state to store the user's input (birthdate) and the calculated age.
	•Implement event handling to trigger age calculation whenever the user updates their input.

5. Learning React Best Practices:
	•Utilize React hooks (useState, useEffect) for managing state and handling lifecycle events.
	•Structure the project with reusable components, promoting clean, modular code.
	•Employ conditional rendering to display the results only after valid input is provided.

6. Design and Responsiveness:
	•Create a simple, responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
	•Make the website visually appealing, possibly adding styles for input fields, buttons, and results display.
